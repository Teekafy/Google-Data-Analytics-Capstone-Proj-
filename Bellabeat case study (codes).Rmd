* Bellabeat Membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

### ***STEP 1: ASK***

In this step, we define the problem and objectives of our case study and its desired outcome.

**1.1 Business Objectives:**

* What are the trends identified?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**1.2 Deliverables:**

* A summary of the business task.
* A description of all data sources used.
* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
* A summary of analysis.
* Supporting visualizations and key findings.

### ***STEP 2: PREPARE***

**2.1 Data Source:**

* The data is publicly available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and stored in 18 csv files.
* Data Collected: The daily activity data set (‘daily_activity’), which contains merged data from other provided files like daily calories, daily intensities, and daily steps, the weight data set (‘weight_info’), and the daily sleep data set (‘daily_sleep’).
* 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.

**2.2 Credibility:**

A good data source should be Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited (ROCCC).

* Reliable: NOT reliable. This data only contains 30 selected individuals.
* Original: NOT original. The data set was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Comprehensive: NOT comprehensive. The data is not comprehensive in the sense that other data (not present) would be useful to create a more accurate analysis (e.g., sex, age, height, etc.).
* Current: NOT current. The data was obtained seven years ago.
*Cited: Cited but NOT credible.

### ***STEP 3: PROCESS***

I cleaned the datasets with EXCEL where I removed duplicates, removed empty rows or columns, did a little formatting, trimmed spaces, etc.
Pinch to zoom. slide and scroll between worksheets to view data.

#### ***But I would do a little more cleaning with R***

***3.1 Loading the Packages:***

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("ggplot2")
library("readr")
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
library("skimr")
library("janitor")
library("scales")
```
***3.1 Importing Datasets:***
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
daily_activity<- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
weight_info <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
```
***3.2 Viewing the data:***
```{r}
head(daily_activity)
```
```{r}
head(daily_sleep)
```
```{r}
head(weight_info)
```
```{r}
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(weight_info)
colnames(daily_sleep)
```
***3.3 Cleaning the data:***

Here, I would be looking for any other missing values, changing column names. Basically I am just perusing my data.

```{r}
daily_activity %>% 
  filter(TotalSteps !=0)
```
```{r my, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
colnames(daily_sleep)[which(names(daily_sleep) == "TotalTimeInBed")] <- "TotalBedTime"
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
n_distinct(daily_sleep$Id)
n_distinct(weight_info$Id)
```

### ***STEP 4: ANALYZE***

Here, I will perform Statistical analysis, get a summary of my data and look at trends.

Summarize data for visualization;
```{r summarization, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
skim_without_charts(daily_activity)
skim_without_charts(daily_sleep)
skim_without_charts(weight_info)
```

Summarize data for Visualization
```{r}
daily_activity_new <- daily_activity %>% 
  select(Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>% 
  rename(Date = ActivityDate)

weight_info_new <- weight_info %>% 
  select(Id, Date, BMI, WeightPounds, IsManualReport)

daily_sleep_new <- daily_sleep %>% 
  select(Id, SleepDay, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalBedTime)
```

***Findings:***

* Total steps recommended by the World Health Organization(WHO): the ideal daily number of steps one should achieve is 10,000. Individuals have an average daily number of total steps to be 7,632.
* Since the average BMI is 25.2, this puts these individuals in the overweight category, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
* The individuals spent on average 955.8 minutes a day being sedentary, that is on average 16 hours a day.
* The ‘Fairly Active Minutes’ equates to on average to 13.63 minutes per day. According to the World Health Organization, adults should do at least 150–300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity. Our participant’s activity in this range equals 95.41 Minutes per week.
* The average person is getting just under the minimum recommended amount of sleep (7 hours) a person should get, according to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF).Bella beat users have an average or 6.9 sleep hours.

### ***STEP 5: SHARE***

***Creating visualizations to communicate insights and findings:***

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=daily_activity) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories), color="purple") +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title="The Relationship Between Total Steps and Calories Burned", x="Total Steps", y="Calories Burned (kcal)")
```
The more steps an individual takes, the more calories are burned. And of course, the more active a person is, the more steps they will take, which then means more calories are burned. The average person from this data set is only reaching about 8000 Total Steps for the day, which equates to just under 2500 calories burned for the day.

### ***A graph comparing minutes of activities using EXCEL (pinch to zoom in and out***
___________
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=daily_activity_new) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=TotalSteps, color="Calories"))+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=TotalSteps, regLineColor= "blue"))+
  labs(title="Calories burned for every step taken", x="Calories Burned", y="Total Steps")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=daily_activity_new) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=VeryActiveMinutes, color="Calories"))+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=VeryActiveMinutes, regLineColor= "blue"))+
  labs(title="Calories burned for every Very Active minutes", x="Calories Burned", y="Very Active Minutes")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
#slicing segments
VeryActiveMin <- sum(daily_activity_new$VeryActiveMinutes)
FairlyActiveMin <- sum(daily_activity_new$FairlyActiveMinutes)
LightlyActiveMin <- sum(daily_activity_new$LightlyActiveMinutes)
SedentaryMin <- sum(daily_activity_new$SedentaryMinutes)
TotalMin <- VeryActiveMin + FairlyActiveMin + LightlyActiveMin + SedentaryMin

# plotting the chart
slices <- c(VeryActiveMin,FairlyActiveMin,LightlyActiveMin,SedentaryMin)
lbls <- c("VeryActive","FairlyActive","LightlyActive","Sedentary")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <- paste(lbls, "%", sep="")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, col = rainbow(length(lbls)), main = "Percentage of Activity in Minutes")
```

### ***STEP 6: ACT***

#### ***Trends Identified:***

* On average, the average Total Steps per day for the participating individuals was 8053, which is almost 2000 steps below the suggested minimum Total Steps per day.
* The participating individuals did not lose weight, did not improve their BMI or sleep quality, and did not see any overall improvement in their activity levels.

#### ***RECOMMENDATIONS:***

* Introduce reminders; this could be a reminder to exercise, sleep, stroll or drink water. This would increase benfits for the users and more usage for the app.
* Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by offering incentives for consistent tracking, like in-app competitions against friends or other users in the same locality.
* Implement a reward system for the users. This could be in the form of a new electronic badge or trophy when completing their desired goal for that day. By earning a small reward, this could help to boost users participation and will make them more likely to achieve their goals.
* Introduce real time graphs and dashboards for users to see activity streaks and trends.
