* Bellabeat Membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

### ***STEP 1: ASK***

In this step, we define the problem and objectives of our case study and its desired outcome.

**1.1 Business Objectives:**

* What are the trends identified?
* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

**1.2 Deliverables:**

* A summary of the business task.
* A description of all data sources used.
* Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
* A summary of analysis.
* Supporting visualizations and key findings.

### ***STEP 2: PREPARE***

**2.1 Data Source:**

* The data is publicly available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and stored in 18 csv files.
* Data Collected: The daily activity data set (‘activity_daily’), which contains merged data from other provided files like daily calories, daily intensities, and daily steps, the weight data set (‘weight’), and the daily sleep data set (‘sleep_daily’).
* 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.

**2.2 Credibility:**

A good data source should be Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited (ROCCC).

* Reliable: NOT reliable. This data only contains 30 selected individuals.
* Original: NOT original. The data set was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
* Comprehensive: NOT comprehensive. The data is not comprehensive in the sense that other data (not present) would be useful to create a more accurate analysis (e.g., sex, age, height, etc.).
* Current: NOT current. The data was obtained seven years ago.
*Cited: Cited but NOT credible.

### ***STEP 3: PROCESS***

I would be using R language to prepare and process the data.

***3.1 Loading the Packages:***

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("ggplot2")
library("readr")
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
library("skimr")
library("janitor")
library("scales")
```
***3.1 Importing Datasets:***
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
activity_daily <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
weight <- read_csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
sleep_daily <- read_csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
```
***3.2 Viewing the data:***
```{r}
head(activity_daily)
```
```{r}
head(sleep_daily)
```
```{r}
head(weight)
```
```{r}
colnames(activity_daily)
colnames(weight)
colnames(sleep_daily)
```
***3.3 Cleaning the data:***

Here, I would be looking for missing values, duplicates, filtering and so forth. Basically I am just perusing my data.

```{r}
activity_daily %>% 
  filter(TotalSteps !=0)
```
```{r my, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
weight %>% 
  separate(Date, c("Date", "Time"), " ")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
n_distinct(activity_daily$Id)
n_distinct(sleep_daily$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)
```

There might be duplicate data. To be on the safe side, I am assigning unique values to a new variable.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sleep_daily_new <- unique(sleep_daily)
weight_new <- unique(weight)
activity_daily_new <- unique(activity_daily)
```

### ***STEP 4: ANALYZE***

Here, I will perform Statistical analysis, get a summary of my data and look at trends.

Summarize data for visualizaton;
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
skim_without_charts(activity_daily)
skim_without_charts(sleep_daily_new)
skim_without_charts(weight_new)
```

Mean of certain data columns;
```{r}
activity_daily_new %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(mean_TotalDistance= mean(TotalDistance))
weight_new %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(mean_Weight= mean(WeightKg))
sleep_daily_new %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(mean_TotalMinutesAsleep= mean(TotalMinutesAsleep))

```
```{r}
activity_daily_final <- activity_daily_new %>% 
  select(Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>% 
  rename(Date = ActivityDate)

weight_final <- weight_new %>% 
  select(Id, Date, BMI, WeightPounds, IsManualReport)

sleep_daily_final <- sleep_daily_new %>% 
  select(Id, SleepDay, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed)
```

***Findings:***

* According to a joint research investigation by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (amongst other research studies), the ideal daily number of Total Steps one should achieve is 10,000.
* Since the average BMI is 25.19, this puts these individuals in the overweight category, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
* The individuals spent on average 955.8 minutes a day being sedentary, that is on average 16 hours a day.
* The average person is getting just under the minimum recommended amount of sleep (7 hours) a person should get, according to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF).

### ***STEP 5: SHARE***

***Creating visualizations to communicate insights and findings:***

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=activity_daily_final) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories), color="purple") +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  labs(title="The Relationship Between Total Steps and Calories Burned", x="Total Steps", y="Calories Burned (kcal)")
```
The more steps an individual takes, the more calories are burned. And of course, the more active a person is, the more steps they will take, which then means more calories are burned. The average person from this data set is only reaching about 8000 Total Steps for the day, which equates to just under 2500 calories burned for the day.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
combined_data <- merge(activity_daily_final, sleep_daily_final, by="Id")

ggplot(data=combined_data) +
    geom_point(mapping=aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=SedentaryMinutes, color="SedentaryMinutes")) +
    geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=SedentaryMinutes, regLineColor="blue")) +
    labs(title="The Relationship Between Activity Levels and Total Minutes Asleep", x="Total Minutes Asleep", y="Minutes of Activity")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=activity_daily_final) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=TotalSteps, color="Calories"))+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=TotalSteps, regLineColor= "blue"))+
  labs(title="Calories burned for every step taken", x="Calories Burned", y="Total Steps")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
ggplot(data=activity_daily_final) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=VeryActiveMinutes, color="Calories"))+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=Calories, y=VeryActiveMinutes, regLineColor= "blue"))+
  labs(title="Calories burned for every Very Active minutes", x="Calories Burned", y="Very Active Minutes")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
#slicing segments
VeryActiveMin <- sum(activity_daily_final$VeryActiveMinutes)
FairlyActiveMin <- sum(activity_daily_final$FairlyActiveMinutes)
LightlyActiveMin <- sum(activity_daily_final$LightlyActiveMinutes)
SedentaryMin <- sum(activity_daily_final$SedentaryMinutes)
TotalMin <- VeryActiveMin + FairlyActiveMin + LightlyActiveMin + SedentaryMin

# plotting the chart
slices <- c(VeryActiveMin,FairlyActiveMin,LightlyActiveMin,SedentaryMin)
lbls <- c("VeryActive","FairlyActive","LightlyActive","Sedentary")
pct <- round(slices/sum(slices)*100)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <- paste(lbls, "%", sep="")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, col = rainbow(length(lbls)), main = "Percentage of Activity in Minutes")
```

### ***STEP 6: ACT***

#### ***Trends Identified:***

* On average, the average Total Steps per day for the participating individuals was 8053, which is almost 2000 steps below the suggested minimum Total Steps per day.
* The participating individuals did not lose weight, did not improve their BMI or sleep quality, and did not see any overall improvement in their activity levels.

#### ***RECOMMENDATIONS:***

* On weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.
* Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by offering incentives for consistent tracking, like in-app competitions against friends or other users in the same locality.
